Modules testing with Javascript
Webpack bundler is used to bundle all the modules and files together for "production" (should be minified)

1. webpack.config.js contains configuration for webpack bundling js files
2. package.json files contains all the dev-dependencies used
3. src folder has the "main app" and modules folder
4. dist folder has the bundled js code to work on "every browser"
